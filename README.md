# TOPSIS-implementation-in-a-python-package
TOPSIS- TECHNIQUE OF ORDER PREFERENCE BY SIMILARITY TO IDEAL SOLUTION


The given program implements topsis in a python program and the python library created for the same. The code of the program is kept as clean and simple as possible for user understanding.


The python package for the same has been published on pypi.org, the link for which is:

https://pypi.org/project/Topsis-Abhay-102016081/ 


This library can be istalled using the command 'pip install Topsis-Abhay-102016081' in your command line interface.
The program takes input in form of the matrix in a csv file and the output is grnerated out also in form of a csv file with the orderof preference/rank assigned to each object. The user along with the matrix also needs to input the weights to be aasigned to each attribute (in form of a float number) and the impact of each attribute (+ve or -ve)
This is highly useful in dealing with multi-attribute or multi-criteria decision making (MADM/MCDM) problems in the real world.
